This mod changes vanilla behavior of raining weather in the game, turning it into an acid rain. You can protect yourself with armor, but keep in mind that it **might break**.<br><br>

<center><b>[The mod is in early stages of development and feedback is appreciated!]</b></center><br>
<br>
The entire mod is configurable. You can change the rate at which the rain damages entities and their armor. You can also change the **color of the rain** (epic).<br><br>
